# BGNSSIW
A Discord bot for logging message edits and deletions.

You will need to create an app in the Discord developer portal, generate a bot user, enable the correct intents, generate the invite URL, invite the bot to your server, and add it to the @admin role. Once completed, insert your bot token into the correct variable, insert the ID of the channel you would like logging to occur in, and run the python script.
